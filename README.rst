Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U**, and here is a list of tools shipped on it:

- Editor: vim/nano
- File Manager: vifm
- Note Taking: joplin

Usage
-----

Simply run the below script to install all configuration files to the home

    $ ./setup.sh


Other Than That

TLDR: after spending time on trying many different "new" and "awesome" tools,
what I come up with is "old is good, simple is enough".
